Looking to get started with Designsystemet as a developer? Our [GitHub README](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet#table-of-contents) contains everything you need â€” including installation, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

To understand how colors, spacing, and typography are handled in code, we also recommend reading about [design tokens](/en/fundamentals/designelements/design-tokens).

If you're collaborating with designers or want to suggest a new component, [this guide can help you understand how to contribute in Figma](/en/fundamentals/for-designers/contribute-in-figma#new-component).
