## Discussions, status updates and collaboration

To succeed with a shared design system, we need a shared place to meet. That’s why we’ve created an open Slack workspace for everyone interested in the Design System – whether you're an active user, considering adopting it, or just curious.

The Slack workspace is a space for asking questions, sharing experiences, and discussing everything from practical challenges to overarching principles. Designers, developers, product owners, and others can exchange ideas, provide feedback, and learn from each other.

We support the use of design systems in general and hope this Slack space will encourage experience sharing and foster a strong professional community across organizations. Together, we grow both the Design System and our collective knowledge about design systems in general.

[Join us on Slack](https://designsystemet.no/slack)
 and share your input – big or small. All questions and contributions are welcome!
